In order to build the firmware, you need to clone at91lib from this
repository: git://git.gnumonks.org/at91lib.git

You need to put the at91lib and osmo-sdr into the same parent directory
or adjust the paths in sdr-test-project/Makefile to match your layout.

There are two independent progams you can build:

1) usb-dfu-project
   This is the bootloader that we flash into the DFU partition
   at the start of the flash

2) osmosdr-project
   This is the actual OsmoSDR firmware.  There are two builds:

   a) smo-sdr-test-osmo-sdr-at91sam3u4-dfu.bin
      This is the image that you can flash into the DFU partition
      using DFU itself

   b) smo-sdr-test-osmo-sdr-at91sam3u4-flash.bin
      This is a self-contained program that you can flash to the
      beginning of the flash (in case you don't want to use DFU)
